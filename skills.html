      Javascript adds interaction to the web page. Javascript can respond to
      events such as the user clicking on an image. Javascript responds by
      rewriting parts of the HTML. Note, the events that Javascript can respond
      too can be as simple as the page loading.

      Javascript is a scripting language, unlike the likes the of HTML which is
      a mark up language. The key difference is that whilst HTML is just a
      series of tags used to give meaning and structure to some text and images,
      Javascript is a language that you as the developer can program, in order
      to have your pages do stuff � be interactive.
    </p>

    <p>
      As such Javascript has many of the common features of others programming
      languages � variables, conditional logic, functions, loops, objects and
      arrays. A grasp of these key concepts will help you in lots of other
      languages but Javascript is a good starting point because of its many uses
      in web design.

    <p>
      The whole point of using Javascript within a web page is to add
      interaction very often involving outputting change to the user � in terms
      of different text, images, HTML or CSS values.
