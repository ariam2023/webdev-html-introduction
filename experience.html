    <h1>Styling</h1>
    

    <p>
      The first role of CSS in the styling of the page. This includes font
      faces, sizes and colours as well as background images and colours
      Positioning Content The box model and the CSS float and position properies
      give designers the necessary tools to lay out web pages.
    </p>

    <p>
      The box model controls an elements border, margin and padding. These can
      be set various ways. The float property can be used with 'normal flow' to
      position content either left or right within a page.
    </p>

    <p>
      Advanced Styling With CSS3 a new range of styling options have opened up.
      These allow designs to have rounded corners, drop shadows, text shadows
      and even to be animated purely through CSS.
